## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Deploy React Application Successfully (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want to deploy my React/Vite application to Vercel so that users can access the web application without encountering Jekyll-related build errors.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - without successful deployment, the application is inaccessible to end users and the project cannot progress.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering a Vercel deployment and verifying the build completes successfully without Ruby gem installation errors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the project has been pushed to the main branch, **When** Vercel automatically triggers a deployment, **Then** the build process must use npm/Vite commands instead of Jekyll
2. **Given** the deployment process starts, **When** Vercel installs dependencies, **Then** only npm packages should be installed, no Ruby gems should be fetched
3. **Given** the build completes, **When** users visit the deployed URL, **Then** they should see the React application rendered correctly

---

### User Story 2 - Maintain Application Functionality (Priority: P2)

As an end user, I want to access all features of the application through the Vercel deployment so that I can use the application as intended.

**Why this priority**: Ensures that fixing the deployment doesn't break existing functionality and provides value to users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating through all pages and features in the deployed application.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is deployed, **When** users visit the home page, **Then** the page should load completely and be interactive
2. **Given** users navigate to different sections, **When** they click navigation links, **Then** all pages should load correctly without 404 errors
3. **Given** users interact with React components, **When** they perform actions like toggling themes or using forms, **Then** all interactions should work as expected

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the Vercel deployment fails due to missing configuration files?
- How does the system handle deployment when both Jekyll and React files are present?
- What occurs when the Node.js version specified in package.json is incompatible with Vercel's runtime?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST configure Vercel to recognize the project as a React/Vite application instead of Jekyll
- **FR-002**: System MUST prevent Ruby gem installation during the Vercel build process
- **FR-003**: System MUST ensure npm packages are installed correctly during deployment
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate static files in the correct output directory for Vercel deployment
- **FR-005**: System MUST configure proper routing for single-page application functionality
- **FR-006**: System MUST update Node.js engine requirements to be compatible with modern Vercel runtime
- **FR-007**: System MUST exclude Jekyll-specific files from deployment to avoid detection conflicts

### Key Entities

- **Vercel Configuration**: Settings that define build process and deployment behavior
- **React Application**: Frontend application built with Vite that needs to be deployed
- **Deployment Artifacts**: Static files generated by Vite build process for serving
- **Jekyll Files**: Legacy files that may interfere with deployment detection

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Vercel deployment completes successfully without Ruby gem installation errors
- **SC-002**: Build process completes in under 3 minutes for standard deployment
- **SC-003**: Application loads within 2 seconds for users accessing the deployed URL
- **SC-004**: 100% of application routes are accessible without 404 errors after deployment
- **SC-005**: Deployment pipeline uses only Node.js and npm commands, no Ruby dependencies
