**Presentation Type**: Poster presentation

**Abstract**: This poster presented first-principles DFT calculations investigating how alloying elements (Sn, Fe, Cr, Nb) affect oxygen diffusion behavior in α-zirconium. The study is important for understanding corrosion mechanisms in zirconium-based nuclear fuel cladding materials.

**Key Topics**:
- First-principles calculations using VASP
- Oxygen diffusion mechanisms in α-Zr
- Effects of alloying elements on diffusion barriers
- Nuclear materials corrosion
- Zirconium alloy design for nuclear applications

**Research Significance**: Understanding oxygen diffusion in zirconium alloys is critical for improving the performance and safety of nuclear fuel cladding materials. This work provides atomic-scale insights into how different alloying elements can be used to control oxidation behavior.
