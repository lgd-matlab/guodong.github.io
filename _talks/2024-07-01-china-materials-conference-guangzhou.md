**Presentation Type**: Oral presentation

**Abstract**: This presentation discussed the application of machine learning methods to predict the stability and formation energy of non-metallic impurities in HCP metals when alloying elements are present. The study utilized SISSO and SHAP algorithms to develop interpretable prediction models based on extensive DFT calculations.

**Key Topics**:
- Machine learning in computational materials science
- SISSO (Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator) algorithm
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for feature interpretation
- HCP metal interstitial behavior
- Effects of alloying elements on non-metallic impurities

**Research Impact**: This work provides a data-driven approach to understanding and predicting interstitial behavior in HCP alloys, which is crucial for designing advanced structural materials with improved mechanical and corrosion properties.
