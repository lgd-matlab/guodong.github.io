# Specification Quality Checklist: Citation Badge Styling Update

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Pass**: All checklist items validated successfully.

- All requirements specify WHAT needs to be achieved (warm colors, consistent theme) without specifying HOW (no SCSS selectors, CSS properties, or implementation details)
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (visual matching, color consistency)
- Two prioritized user stories cover the core use case (viewing citation badges) and secondary interaction (hover states)
- Edge cases identify boundary conditions (zero citations, loading failures, responsive design, theme switching)
- Scope clearly bounded with explicit "Out of Scope" section
- Dependencies documented (file locations) without prescribing implementation approach
- Assumptions document reasonable defaults (warm color preference, functionality preservation)

**Status**: âœ… Ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)
