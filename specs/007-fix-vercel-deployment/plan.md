# Implementation Plan: Fix Vercel Deployment Configuration

**Branch**: `007-fix-vercel-deployment` | **Date**: 2025-10-28 | **Spec**: [specs/007-fix-vercel-deployment/spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/007-fix-vercel-deployment/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This implementation plan addresses the critical issue where Vercel incorrectly detects the React/Vite application as a Jekyll site due to the presence of legacy Jekyll files (`_config.yml`, `Gemfile`, etc.). The solution involves explicit Vercel configuration to force Vite framework detection, file exclusion patterns to prevent Jekyll file processing, and package dependency cleanup to ensure compatibility with modern Vercel runtime.

**Technical Approach**: Create explicit `vercel.json` configuration with framework specification, implement `.vercelignore` to exclude Jekyll files, update package.json for Node.js 18+ compatibility, and configure SPA routing for React application.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.9.3 + JavaScript (ES2022)
**Primary Dependencies**: Vite 6.0.0, React 18.3.1, React DOM 18.3.1
**Storage**: Static files in Vercel CDN (no database required)
**Testing**: Jest 29.7.0, React Testing Library 13.4.0
**Target Platform**: Vercel hosting platform (Node.js 18+ runtime)
**Project Type**: Single web application (static React SPA)
**Performance Goals**: Build time < 3 minutes, page load < 2 seconds, 100% route accessibility
**Constraints**: Must maintain existing Jekyll functionality locally, no breaking changes to source code
**Scale/Scope**: Single application deployment, global CDN distribution

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure with explicit deployment configuration. The existing repository structure is preserved with additional Vercel-specific configuration files. Jekyll files remain for local development but are excluded from Vercel deployment.

## Complexity Tracking

*No violations requiring justification - all constitution gates passed*

## Phase 0: Research Summary ✅ COMPLETED

**Research Findings** ([research.md](research.md)):
- Identified root cause: Vercel auto-detects Jekyll due to `_config.yml` presence
- Resolved explicit framework configuration using `vercel.json`
- Established file exclusion patterns via `.vercelignore`
- Determined Node.js 18+ compatibility requirements
- Confirmed SPA routing configuration needs

**Key Decisions**:
- Use explicit `"framework": "vite"` in vercel.json
- Exclude all Jekyll detection triggers with .vercelignore
- Update Node.js engine requirement to >= 18.0.0
- Configure SPA rewrites for client-side routing

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts ✅ COMPLETED

**Data Model** ([data-model.md](data-model.md)):
- Defined configuration entities for Vercel deployment
- Established build artifact relationships
- Created validation rules for deployment configuration
- Documented state transitions for deployment process

**API Contracts** ([contracts/deployment-api.yaml](contracts/deployment-api.yaml)):
- Vercel platform configuration schema
- Build process contract specifications
- SPA routing configuration contracts
- File exclusion pattern definitions
