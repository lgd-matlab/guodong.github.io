# Tasks: Fix Vercel Deployment Configuration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/007-fix-vercel-deployment/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL for this deployment configuration feature. Only include deployment validation tasks as specified in the requirements.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, tests at repository root
- **Configuration files**: Repository root (`vercel.json`, `.vercelignore`)
- **Package files**: Repository root (`package.json`, `vite.config.ts`)

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create backup of current deployment configuration in vercel.json.backup
- [ ] T002 Document current build issues and deployment errors in docs/deployment-issues.md
- [ ] T003 [P] Review existing Vite configuration in vite.config.ts for compatibility

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core deployment infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T004 Update Node.js engine requirement in package.json to >= 18.0.0
- [ ] T005 [P] Remove duplicate vite dependencies from package.json devDependencies
- [ ] T006 [P] Consolidate @types/react and @types/react-dom dependencies in package.json
- [ ] T007 [P] Validate package.json scripts for build and development commands
- [ ] T008 Update vite.config.ts with explicit build output configuration
- [ ] T009 Configure proper build settings in vite.config.ts for production deployment

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - Vercel deployment infrastructure prepared

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Deploy React Application Successfully (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Configure Vercel to recognize and build the React/Vite application instead of Jekyll

**Independent Test**: Trigger Vercel deployment and verify build completes without Ruby gem installation errors

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T010 [US1] Create vercel.json with explicit Vite framework configuration in vercel.json
- [ ] T011 [US1] Configure build commands in vercel.json (buildCommand: "npm run build")
- [ ] T012 [US1] Set output directory in vercel.json (outputDirectory: "dist")
- [ ] T013 [US1] Configure install command in vercel.json (installCommand: "npm install")
- [ ] T014 [US1] Add SPA routing rewrites in vercel.json for client-side routing
- [ ] T015 [US1] Create .vercelignore file in repository root
- [ ] T016 [US1] Add Jekyll configuration files to .vercelignore (_config.yml, Gemfile, Gemfile.lock)
- [ ] T017 [US1] Add Jekyll directories to .vercelignore (_layouts/, _posts/, _includes/, _data/, _sass/)
- [ ] T018 [US1] Add Jekyll build artifacts to .vercelignore (_site/, .jekyll-cache/, .jekyll-metadata)
- [ ] T019 [US1] Add development files to .vercelignore (.git/, node_modules/, *.log)
- [ ] T020 [US1] Test local build process with `npm run build` command
- [ ] T021 [US1] Verify dist/ directory structure contains all required assets
- [ ] T022 [US1] Test local preview with `npm run preview` command
- [ ] T023 [US1] Validate index.html references correct asset paths
- [ ] T024 [US1] Commit configuration changes to Git repository
- [ ] T025 [US1] Push changes to trigger Vercel deployment
- [ ] T026 [US1] Monitor Vercel build logs for Ruby gem installation errors
- [ ] T027 [US1] Verify Vercel deployment completes successfully
- [ ] T028 [US1] Test deployed application loads correctly from Vercel URL
- [ ] T029 [US1] Validate deployment meets success criteria (SC-001, SC-005)

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 should be fully functional - React application deploys successfully without Jekyll interference

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Maintain Application Functionality (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Ensure all application features work correctly after Vercel deployment configuration

**Independent Test**: Navigate through all pages and features in the deployed application

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T030 [US2] Test home page loads completely and is interactive in deployed application
- [ ] T031 [US2] Test navigation links work correctly without 404 errors
- [ ] T032 [US2] Test React components render properly in deployed environment
- [ ] T033 [US2] Test theme toggle functionality works in deployed application
- [ ] T034 [US2] Test form interactions and user input handling
- [ ] T035 [US2] Test static assets (images, CSS, fonts) load correctly
- [ ] T036 [US2] Test application performance meets loading time requirements (< 2 seconds)
- [ ] T037 [US2] Test all client-side routes work with SPA configuration
- [ ] T038 [US2] Validate 100% route accessibility (SC-004)
- [ ] T039 [US2] Test application responsiveness on different screen sizes
- [ ] T040 [US2] Validate application functionality matches local development behavior
- [ ] T041 [US2] Document any deployment-specific differences in docs/deployment-notes.md

**Checkpoint**: User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work - Application deploys successfully and functions correctly

---

## Phase 5: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect the deployment configuration and documentation

- [ ] T042 [P] Create deployment troubleshooting guide in docs/troubleshooting.md
- [ ] T043 [P] Update project README.md with Vercel deployment instructions
- [ ] T044 [P] Document rollback procedures in docs/rollback.md
- [ ] T045 Create deployment validation checklist in docs/deployment-checklist.md
- [ ] T046 [P] Optimize build configuration for performance improvements
- [ ] T047 Configure appropriate caching headers for static assets
- [ ] T048 [P] Add deployment status monitoring documentation
- [ ] T049 Document maintenance procedures for Vercel deployment
- [ ] T050 Run comprehensive deployment validation following quickstart.md

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion - CRITICAL for deployment
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion - requires successful deployment
- **Polish (Phase 5)**: Depends on User Stories 1 AND 2 being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Must complete before User Story 2 - provides deployment infrastructure
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on User Story 1 - validates deployed application functionality

### Within Each User Story

- Configuration files must be created in specific order (vercel.json → .vercelignore → testing)
- Local testing before Git commit
- Git commit before Vercel deployment
- Vercel deployment before final validation

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Most Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Configuration tasks within User Story 1 can be parallelized after initial setup
- Testing tasks can run in parallel with documentation updates
- Polish phase tasks can run in parallel after user stories complete

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch configuration file creation together:
Task: "Create vercel.json with explicit Vite framework configuration in vercel.json"
Task: "Create .vercelignore file in repository root"

# Launch exclusion pattern configuration together:
Task: "Add Jekyll configuration files to .vercelignore (_config.yml, Gemfile, Gemfile.lock)"
Task: "Add Jekyll directories to .vercelignore (_layouts/, _posts/, _includes/, _data/, _sass/)"
Task: "Add Jekyll build artifacts to .vercelignore (_site/, .jekyll-cache/, .jekyll-metadata)"

# Launch validation testing together:
Task: "Test local build process with `npm run build` command"
Task: "Verify dist/ directory structure contains all required assets"
Task: "Test local preview with `npm run preview` command"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks deployment)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test Vercel deployment independently
5. Deploy and verify successful React application deployment

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Deployment infrastructure ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy (MVP - React app deploys without Jekyll!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Validate full functionality
4. Add Polish phase → Documentation and optimization complete
5. Each phase adds value without breaking previous achievements

### Critical Path Analysis

**Critical Path**: T004 → T010 → T025 → T027 → T028
- Must update Node.js (T004) before creating vercel.json (T010)
- Must create vercel.json (T010) before committing changes (T025)
- Must commit changes (T025) before Vercel deployment (T027)
- Must complete deployment (T027) before testing (T028)

## Success Metrics Validation

### Build Process Validation (T020-T029)
- Build completion time < 3 minutes (SC-002)
- No Ruby gem installation errors (SC-001, SC-005)
- npm build process completes successfully

### Application Performance Validation (T030-T041)
- Application load time < 2 seconds (SC-003)
- 100% route accessibility (SC-004)
- All React components function correctly

### Deployment Quality Validation (T042-T050)
- Documentation complete and accurate
- Troubleshooting guides available
- Rollback procedures documented

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- User Story 1 is CRITICAL and enables all subsequent functionality
- Each checkpoint must be validated before proceeding to next phase
- Commit after each logical group of tasks
- Test deployment thoroughly after User Story 1 completion
- Monitor Vercel build logs closely for any unexpected behavior
- Prepare rollback plan before starting deployment changes

---

## Total Task Count: 50

### Tasks by User Story:
- **Setup Phase**: 3 tasks
- **Foundational Phase**: 6 tasks
- **User Story 1**: 20 tasks (P1 - Critical MVP)
- **User Story 2**: 12 tasks (P2 - Functionality validation)
- **Polish Phase**: 9 tasks

### Parallel Opportunities:
- **High Parallelization**: 24 tasks marked [P]
- **Sequential Dependencies**: 26 tasks with specific ordering requirements
- **MVP Critical Path**: 5 core tasks that must complete sequentially
