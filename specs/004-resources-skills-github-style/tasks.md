# Tasks: Resources Page Skills and GitHub Projects Styling

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-resources-skills-github-style/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Manual testing approach - no automated tests specified in feature requirements

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Jekyll Site**: `_pages/`, `_includes/`, `_sass/`, `assets/` at repository root
- **Documentation**: `specs/004-resources-skills-github-style/`
- **Target File**: Primary modifications in `_pages/resources.html`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure preparation

- [X] T001 Create backup of current resources.html file
- [X] T002 Verify Jekyll server runs correctly on current branch
- [X] T003 Document current Resources page structure and existing CSS patterns

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core analysis and preparation that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T004 Analyze existing Tools section CSS patterns in _pages/resources.html
- [X] T005 Identify current Skills data sources in _pages/cv.md
- [X] T006 Document existing GitHub Projects structure and styling
- [X] T007 Verify existing badge color system and hover effects
- [X] T008 Confirm responsive breakpoints and mobile patterns
- [X] T009 Validate current accessibility implementation

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - View Skills in Professional Card Layout (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Create a new Skills section with professional card-based layout matching the Tools section styling

**Independent Test**: Visit Resources page ‚Üí Skills section displays with card layout, bold borders, hover effects, and proper category organization without affecting other sections

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Maintain Consistent Academic Visual Theme (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Ensure visual consistency across all Resources page sections (Tools, Skills, GitHub Projects)

**Independent Test**: View entire Resources page ‚Üí all sections follow same bold border styling, consistent spacing, harmonious typography, and unified professional academic aesthetic

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T028 [US3] Audit border consistency across Tools, Skills, and Projects sections in _pages/resources.html
- [X] T029 [US3] Verify typography hierarchy consistency across all sections in _pages/resources.html
- [X] T030 [US3] Ensure badge color system applied consistently in _pages/resources.html

## Dependencies

### Story Completion Order

1. **Phase 1 & 2 (Setup & Foundational)**: T001-T009 must complete first
2. **User Stories (Can run in parallel after Phase 2)**:
   - **US1 (Skills)**: T010-T019
   - **US2 (GitHub Projects)**: T020-T027
   - **US3 (Visual Consistency)**: T028-T035
3. **Phase 6 (Polish)**: T036-T047 must complete after all user stories

### Critical Dependencies

- T010-T019 (Skills implementation) ‚Üí T028-T035 (Visual consistency validation)
- T020-T027 (GitHub Projects update) ‚Üí T028-T035 (Visual consistency validation)

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

### Within User Story 1 (Skills Section)
- T011, T012, T013: Creating different skill categories can be done in parallel
- T016, T017: Badge and button styling can be done in parallel

### Within User Story 2 (GitHub Projects)
- T020, T021, T025: Border, shadow, and radius updates can be done in parallel
- T022, T026: Typography and meta styling can be done in parallel

### Within User Story 3 (Visual Consistency)
- T028, T029, T030: Border, typography, and badge consistency checks can be done in parallel

### Within Phase 6 (Polish)
- T036, T037, T038: Functional, responsive, and accessibility testing can be done in parallel
- T043, T044, T045: Browser testing, visual consistency, and JavaScript-disabled testing can be done in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope (First Deliverable)
**Complete User Story 1 only**: Skills section with professional card layout
- Tasks: T001-T009 (Setup) + T010-T019 (Skills implementation)
- Independent test: Skills section functional without affecting existing content
- Value: Immediate visual enhancement with new content section

### Incremental Delivery
1. **MVP Release**: US1 (Skills section) ‚Üí Test and validate
2. **Feature Complete**: Add US2 (GitHub Projects styling) ‚Üí Full visual consistency
3. **Production Ready**: Add US3 (Cross-section consistency) + Phase 6 (Polish)

### Risk Mitigation
- **Backup Strategy**: T001 creates backup before any modifications
- **Incremental Testing**: Each user story independently testable
- **Rollback Plan**: Individual sections can be reverted without affecting others
- **Performance Guard**: T041 ensures page load time requirements met

## Success Metrics
