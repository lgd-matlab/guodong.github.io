# Specification Quality Checklist: Resources Page Styling Update

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED (Updated: 2025-10-28)

All checklist items passed validation:

1. **Content Quality**: The specification describes the Resources page styling from a user perspective, focusing on visual presentation, layout, and user experience without mentioning specific CSS frameworks, build tools, or implementation technologies.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 15 functional requirements are specific and testable (e.g., "MUST display in a responsive grid layout with minimum 280px per card"). Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "page layout adapts smoothly across all device sizes"). Edge cases cover boundary conditions like missing data, long text, and API failures.

3. **Feature Readiness**: Each of the 3 user stories has clear acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format. The stories are prioritized (P1 for tools/buttons, P2 for GitHub projects) and independently testable. No implementation details (CSS classes, JavaScript functions, etc.) appear in the specification.

## Notes

**Update**: Dark mode requirements removed per user request. The specification now focuses on light mode styling only, matching the reference academic site.

The specification is complete and ready for planning phase. No updates required before proceeding to `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
