# Implementation Plan: React Interface Conversion

**Branch**: `006-react-interface-conversion` | **Date**: 2025-10-28 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/006-react-interface-conversion/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript/TypeScript with React 18+  
**Primary Dependencies**: React, React DOM, Webpack/Vite, NEEDS CLARIFICATION for existing interface analysis  
**Storage**: N/A (frontend conversion)  
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, NEEDS CLARIFICATION for existing test coverage  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (existing browser compatibility requirements)  
**Project Type**: web (frontend component conversion)  
**Performance Goals**: Match or exceed existing interface performance, NEEDS CLARIFICATION for specific metrics  
**Constraints**: Preserve existing functionality, maintain accessibility, incremental conversion  
**Scale/Scope**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION for number of components to convert

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Principle VI (Code Quality Standards)**: ✅ COMPLIANT - React conversion requires professional code standards
**Principle VII (Testing Discipline)**: ✅ COMPLIANT - All converted components must be tested before deployment
**Principle VIII (User Experience Consistency)**: ✅ COMPLIANT - Requirement FR-002 ensures identical appearance
**Principle IX (Performance Requirements)**: ✅ COMPLIANT - FR-004 requires performance maintenance

**GATE STATUS**: ✅ PASSED - No constitution violations identified

**Structure Decision**: This is a frontend interface conversion project within the existing Jekyll academic website. The React components will likely be integrated into the existing Jekyll build process or served as a separate frontend application that connects to existing Jekyll content.
