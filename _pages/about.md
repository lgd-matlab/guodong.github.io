Hello! I'm Guodong Lu (鲁国栋), a Research Assistant at Hunan University in Changsha, China. I specialize in computational materials science with a focus on machine learning applications in materials design and first-principles calculations.

I earned my M.S. in Materials Science and Engineering from Hunan University (June 2025, GPA: 3.68/4.0) and my B.S. from Dalian Jiaotong University (June 2022, GPA: 86.61/100). Currently, I continue my research as a Research Assistant at Hunan University (August 2025 - Present).

## Research Interests

My research focuses on computational materials science with specific interests in:

- **Machine Learning in Materials Science**: Active learning, interpretable ML models (SISSO, SHAP), and data-driven materials discovery
- **First-Principles Calculations**: Using DFT (VASP) to investigate atomic-scale interactions in metallic systems
- **High-Throughput Computations**: Implementing automated workflows for large-scale materials screening
- **Molecular Dynamics**: Large-scale atomistic simulations for complex material systems

## Personal Interests

Beyond research, I enjoy a variety of activities that help me maintain balance and perspective:

- **History & Knowledge Organization**: I'm an avid reader of history books, with particular interests in world history, military history, and Chinese history. I also enjoy books on time management and knowledge organization systems, which help me stay productive and organized in both research and daily life.

- **Sports & Fitness**: I play table tennis (ping-pong) regularly and visit the gym to exercise. Physical activity helps me stay energetic and manage stress, especially during challenging research periods. Staying active keeps my mind sharp and focused.

- **Self-Hosted Projects**: I enjoy experimenting with GitHub projects on my personal server. It's a fun way to explore new technologies, practice deployment skills, and learn about server management outside of my research work.
