Hello! I'm Guodong Lu (鲁国栋), a Research Assistant at Hunan University in Changsha, China. I specialize in computational materials science with a focus on machine learning applications in materials design and first-principles calculations.

## Education & Experience

I earned my M.S. in Materials Science and Engineering from Hunan University (June 2025, GPA: 3.68/4.0) and my B.S. from Dalian Jiaotong University (June 2022, GPA: 86.61/100). Currently, I continue my research as a Research Assistant at Hunan University (August 2025 - Present).

## Research Interests

My research focuses on computational materials science with specific interests in:

- **Machine Learning in Materials Science**: Active learning, interpretable ML models (SISSO, SHAP), and data-driven materials discovery
- **First-Principles Calculations**: Using DFT (VASP) to investigate atomic-scale interactions in metallic systems
- **High-Throughput Computations**: Implementing automated workflows for large-scale materials screening
- **Molecular Dynamics**: Large-scale atomistic simulations for complex material systems

## Personal Interests

Beyond computational research, I am passionate about:

- **Open Science & Knowledge Sharing**: I maintain this website and blog to share tutorials and insights on computational materials science techniques, including VASP, LAMMPS, and machine learning methods. I believe in making scientific knowledge accessible to the broader research community.
- **Scientific Computing**: Exploring new computational methods and tools to improve research efficiency and reproducibility. I enjoy learning about emerging technologies in scientific computing and high-performance computing.
- **Interdisciplinary Research**: Bridging materials science with data science and computational physics. I'm particularly interested in how machine learning can accelerate materials discovery and provide physical insights.
- **Reproducible Research**: Advocating for best practices in computational research, including code sharing, detailed documentation, and reproducibility standards in computational materials science.

## Technical Skills

**Computational Tools**:
- **First-principles**: VASP, AFLOW, Elastool
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, ASE, pymatgen, SHAP, SISSO
- **Molecular Dynamics**: LAMMPS
- **Programming**: Python (advanced), Shell scripting
- **High-Performance Computing**: Experience with parallel computing and cluster environments

**Languages**: English (Fluent, IELTS 6.5), Chinese (Native)

## Selected Publications

I have published 5 peer-reviewed articles (including 2 as first author and 1 as co-first author) in journals such as *Advanced Functional Materials*, *Journal of Nuclear Materials*, *Computational Materials Science*, and *Materials & Design*. Please visit the [Publications](/publications/) page for complete details.

## Honors & Awards

- Outstanding Graduate of Hunan University (2025)
- National Graduate Scholarship (2024)
- Outstanding Graduate of Dalian City (2022)
- First Prize, National College Students Mathematics Competition, Liaoning Province (2021)
