## About me

I'm a research assistant and computational materials scientist at [Hunan University](http://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/). My work focuses on machine learning applications in materials design and first-principles calculations, with particular attention to data-driven materials discovery and atomic-scale interactions within metallic systems.

My research directions include exploring how machine learning, high-throughput computations, and molecular dynamics can support meaningful materials discovery and informed decision making. I study how computational methods are shaped and how they make informed decisions in materials science. My broader aim is to reform how computational theories, methods, and interventions are developed by making them more data-driven, efficient, and grounded in first-principles understanding, and to inspire change in the materials science community and ultimately in technology development itself.

Before I started working as a research assistant, I earned my Master's degree in Materials Science and Engineering from [Hunan University](http://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/), where I focused on machine learning and DFT calculations. My work has received awards and recognitions, including outstanding research achievements in computational materials science, which encourage me to continue making materials science more inclusive and practically relevant.

I am also interested in knowledge organization, history reading, and self-hosted projects. Beyond research, I enjoy reading history books (world history, military history, and Chinese history), exploring time management systems, and deploying various [GitHub projects](https://github.com/lgd-matlab) on my personal server üåê. I also play table tennis regularly and visit the gym to stay active and energetic üí™.
