A comprehensive guide to VASP (Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package) for first-principles calculations in materials science.

## Coming Soon

This post will cover:
- Introduction to VASP and DFT calculations
- Basic workflow and input files (POSCAR, INCAR, KPOINTS, POTCAR)
- Practical tips for convergence testing
- Common calculation types (structure optimization, DOS, band structure)
- Real-world examples from my research

*This tutorial is currently in preparation. Check back soon for the complete guide!*
