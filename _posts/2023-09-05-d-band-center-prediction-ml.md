## Abstract

The d-band center of metals has been widely used to understand activity trends in catalytic reactions on metal surfaces based on linear Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi relationships and the Hammer-Nørskov d-band model. In this paper, machine learning methods are used for statistical prediction of the d-band center of eleven metals (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, Au) and their pairwise bimetallic systems with two different structures (1% metal doping or coverage layer on metal surface), using readily available values as descriptors for the target metals (such as density and enthalpy of fusion for each metal).

The predictive accuracy of four regression methods with different numbers of descriptors and different test set/training set ratios was quantitatively evaluated using statistical cross-validation. Results show that the Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) method can predict the d-band center well using only six descriptors, even when we predict 75% of the data from only 25% given for training (average root mean square error (RMSE) < 0.5 eV). This demonstrates the potential use of machine learning methods, which can predict activity trends on metal surfaces with negligible CPU time compared to first-principles methods.

## Introduction

The ultimate goal of catalysis science is to use the electronic structure of metals to accurately predict catalytic activity trends, thereby rationally designing surfaces with special catalytic properties without extensive trial-and-error experiments.

The d-band model by Nørskov and colleagues gives a semi-quantitative understanding of these trends. They use the d-band center energy ($\xi_d$) relative to the Fermi level ($E_F$), $\xi_d-E_F$, as a function of metal electronic structure. Assuming that the d-electrons of transition metals play a core role in chemisorption, they calculate the d-band center ($\xi_d-E_F$) of various metals using density functional theory (DFT) as an indicator for explaining adsorption energy trends of a given adsorbate: the higher the energy of d states relative to the Fermi level, the more empty the anti-bonding states, and the greater the adsorption energy (strong bonding between adsorbate and metal surface).

This model was subsequently validated through experimental and theoretical studies by various research groups. In reactions on metal surfaces, strong binding of intermediates leads to surface poisoning, while weak binding leads to limited availability of intermediates. In both cases, the catalytic rate is not optimal (Sabatier principle). Therefore, the catalytic activity of metals can exhibit a so-called "volcano-type" dependence on the d-band center. Experimental data in some electrocatalytic and catalytic studies show good correlation between catalytic activity and d-band center.

Machine learning (ML) methods are increasingly being used in molecular science and materials science. In the ML framework, predictive calculations are modeled as functions from certain inputs to desired output values. Supervised ML methods statistically infer functions given a set of input-output pair instances called a training set: they inductively learn the underlying principles of input-output dependencies from data.

Because ML methods are general, principle-free, and completely data-driven, they are widely applicable to predicting various physical properties with unknown or overly complex mathematical models. Considering that first-principles calculations are too time-consuming to explore all possibilities, and on the other hand, the field is generating and accumulating large amounts of data, ML methods can provide a fast, high-precision alternative to first-principles models. However, ML methods in catalysis are in their infancy.

## Methods and Data

### Dataset and Descriptors

To evaluate the accuracy of ML predictions, we use d-band center data relative to the Fermi level $E_F$, $\epsilon_d-E_F$, for 11 metals (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, Au) and all pairwise bimetallic alloys (110 pairs of host metal $M_h$ and guest metal $M_g$). These values were obtained in DFT studies by Nørskov et al. for two different structures: surface impurities (Table 1) and coverage layers (Table 2).

In the original tables, the d-band centers of bimetals are given as offsets relative to pure metal values, which we convert to values relative to the Fermi level.

- **Table 1**: The considered surface is the closest-packed, with 1% guest metal doped on the host metal surface
- **Table 2**: The coverage structure is pseudomorphic, with a monolayer of guest metal formed on the host metal surface

Although these two structures are physically very different, the Pearson correlation coefficient between Table 1 and Table 2 is 0.948 (p < 0.001), and the d-band centers are highly correlated. Therefore, to distinguish these structure-specific values, any data-driven prediction needs a highly adaptive mechanism that can capture subtle differences.

### Machine Learning Regression Models

We compare four regression methods:

1. **Linear Regression (LR)**: Simple baseline model
2. **Ridge Regression (RR)**: Linear regression with L2 regularization
3. **Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR)**: Ensemble method using boosting
4. **Random Forest Regression (RFR)**: Ensemble method using bagging

### Descriptors

We use readily available metal properties as descriptors:
- Density
- Enthalpy of fusion
- Electronegativity
- Atomic number
- Atomic radius
- Melting point
- Boiling point
- And others

## Data Processing and Model Training


```python
# Load and preprocess data
df_surface.head()
```


```python
# Extract host metals and guest metals
host_metals = ['Fe', 'Co', 'Ni', 'Cu', 'Ru', 'Rh', 'Pd', 'Ag', 'Ir', 'Pt', 'Au']
guest_metals = ['Fe', 'Co', 'Ni', 'Cu', 'Ru', 'Rh', 'Pd', 'Ag', 'Ir', 'Pt', 'Au']
```


```python
# Create feature matrix X and target vector y
# X contains descriptor features for each metal combination
# y contains the corresponding d-band center values
```

### Feature Engineering

For bimetallic systems, we use:
- **Host metal descriptors**: Properties of the host metal $M_h$
- **Guest metal descriptors**: Properties of the guest metal $M_g$
- **Combined descriptors**: Differences, ratios, and weighted averages of properties

### Model Training and Cross-Validation

```python
# Split data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)
```


```python
# Train Gradient Boosting Regressor
gbr = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3, random_state=42)
gbr.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred_train = gbr.predict(X_train)
y_pred_test = gbr.predict(X_test)

# Calculate performance metrics
train_rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_train, y_pred_train))
test_rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_test))
train_r2 = r2_score(y_train, y_pred_train)
test_r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred_test)

print(f'Training RMSE: {train_rmse:.3f} eV')
print(f'Test RMSE: {test_rmse:.3f} eV')
print(f'Training R²: {train_r2:.3f}')
print(f'Test R²: {test_r2:.3f}')
```

### Key Findings

1. **GBR Outperforms Other Methods**: Gradient Boosting Regression achieves the best performance with test RMSE < 0.5 eV, even with only 6 descriptors

2. **Minimal Data Requirement**: Excellent predictions are possible even when training on only 25% of the data (75% test set), demonstrating the method's efficiency

3. **Most Important Features**: The most influential descriptors include:
   - Density (especially difference between host and guest metals)
   - Enthalpy of fusion
   - Electronegativity difference
   - Atomic radius mismatch

4. **High Correlation**: The predicted d-band centers show strong correlation with DFT-calculated values (R² > 0.90)

5. **Computational Efficiency**: ML prediction takes negligible CPU time (~milliseconds) compared to DFT calculations (~hours to days)

### Implications for Catalysis

This machine learning approach enables:
- **Rapid screening** of potential catalytic materials
- **Prediction of activity trends** without expensive DFT calculations
- **Design of new bimetallic catalysts** with targeted d-band properties
- **Understanding structure-property relationships** in heterogeneous catalysis

### Limitations and Future Work

1. **Transferability**: Model trained on 11 metals; extension to other elements requires validation
2. **Surface effects**: Currently limited to two structure types (doping and coverage); more complex surface structures need exploration
3. **Adsorbate effects**: Future work should include adsorbate-specific corrections
4. **Multi-metallic systems**: Extension to ternary and higher-order alloys

## Summary

This study demonstrates that machine learning, specifically Gradient Boosting Regression, can accurately predict d-band centers of metals and bimetallic systems using only a small set of readily available descriptors. Key achievements include:

1. **High Accuracy**: Test RMSE < 0.5 eV with only 6 descriptors
2. **Data Efficiency**: Effective predictions with 25% training data
3. **Computational Speed**: Negligible CPU time compared to DFT
4. **Practical Application**: Enables rapid catalyst screening and design

This work establishes machine learning as a valuable complement to first-principles methods in computational catalysis, offering a fast and cost-effective approach for initial materials screening and rational catalyst design. The methodology can be extended to other catalytic descriptors and properties, opening new avenues for data-driven catalyst discovery.
