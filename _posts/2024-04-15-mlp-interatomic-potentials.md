An introduction to machine learning potentials (MLPs) for molecular dynamics simulations with near-DFT accuracy.

## Coming Soon

This post will cover:
- What are machine learning potentials and why use them
- Popular MLP methods (Behler-Parrinello, GAP, MTP, GNN)
- Complete workflow: from DFT data generation to production MD
- Best practices for training and validation
- Real-world applications and case studies
- Software tools and resources

*This tutorial is currently in preparation. Check back soon for the complete guide!*
