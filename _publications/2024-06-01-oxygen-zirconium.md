## Abstract

Zirconium alloys, being crucial materials in the nuclear industry, frequently encounter issues related to oxidative corrosion. Understanding the interaction between oxygen atoms and alloying atoms at the atomistic scale is helpful for optimizing Zr alloys with improved corrosion resistance. In the present study, a first-principles approach is used to understand the stability and diffusion properties of oxygen in α-Zr with common alloying elements including Sn, Fe, Cr, and Nb. The binding energies between oxygen and alloying atoms are calculated to evaluate their interaction strength. Furthermore, theoretical models are developed to predict the effects of these alloying elements on oxygen diffusion behavior in α-Zr. The results provide atomic-level insights into the role of alloying elements in oxygen transport and corrosion mechanisms, offering guidelines for the design of zirconium alloys with enhanced corrosion resistance for nuclear applications.

This work executed comprehensive DFT calculations to analyze the interactions between oxygen and alloying elements in α-Zr. The study predicts the effects of various alloying elements (Sn, Fe, Cr, Nb) on oxygen diffusion behavior based on theoretical models, providing valuable insights for nuclear materials design.
