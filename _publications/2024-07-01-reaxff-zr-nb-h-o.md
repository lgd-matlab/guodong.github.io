## Abstract

In this work, a Zr-Nb-H-O reactive force field (ReaxFF) is constructed to study the corrosion mechanisms and irradiation effect of Zr-Nb alloys at the atomic landscape. This ReaxFF can describe the interactions between water dissociation products and Zr-Nb alloys, and the stability as well as diffusion properties of irradiation defects in Zr bulk. The force field was trained against an extensive database of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, including various atomic configurations such as bulk properties, surface energies, vacancy and interstitial defects, and chemical reactions involving water dissociation. The developed ReaxFF enables large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the complex corrosion processes and radiation damage mechanisms in zirconium-based nuclear materials, which are critical for understanding in-reactor behavior of nuclear fuel cladding materials.

This study developed a reactive force field (ReaxFF) for Zr-Nb-Sn-H-O systems to enable large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of in-reactor corrosion behavior.
