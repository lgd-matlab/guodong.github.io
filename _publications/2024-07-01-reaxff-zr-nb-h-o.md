This study developed a reactive force field (ReaxFF) for Zr-Nb-Sn-H-O systems to enable large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of in-reactor corrosion behavior.

**Role**: Co-author

**Research Contributions**:
- Performed comprehensive DFT calculations on ~100 atomic configurations
- Generated training data including vacancy, interstitial, and substitutional interactions
- Validated the force field parameters against DFT results
- Contributed to the understanding of complex interactions in zirconium-based nuclear materials
