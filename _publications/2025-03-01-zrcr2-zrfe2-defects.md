This study employs first-principles calculations to investigate thermodynamic defect behavior in ZrCr₂ and ZrFe₂ Laves phases, which are important secondary phase particles (SPPs) in zirconium alloys.

**Role**: First author

**Research Focus**:
- Vacancy and antisite defect formation energies
- Temperature-dependent defect concentrations
- Implications for mechanical and corrosion properties
- Connection to microstructural evolution in zirconium alloys

**Status**: In preparation for submission
