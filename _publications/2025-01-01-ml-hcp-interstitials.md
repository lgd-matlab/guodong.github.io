## Abstract

This study develops a data-driven framework to accurately predict formation energy and stability while elucidating their underlying mechanisms. We integrated density functional theory (DFT) calculations with machine learning (ML) techniques to investigate non-metal interstitials in HCP metals containing substitutional elements. We constructed an automated procedure to label the stability of interstices, which is very important for constructing the dataset. Using a comprehensive database of over 1,050 DFT calculations, we developed interpretable machine learning models that combine the Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) method with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. The SISSO method generated compact, physically meaningful descriptors that accurately predict both the stability and formation energy of non-metallic interstitials in various HCP alloy systems. The SHAP analysis provided deep insights into feature importance and the role of different alloying elements in modulating interstitial properties. Our approach achieves high prediction accuracy while maintaining interpretability, offering valuable guidelines for the rational design of HCP alloys with controlled interstitial behavior. This work demonstrates the powerful synergy between first-principles calculations and machine learning for accelerating materials discovery and design.
