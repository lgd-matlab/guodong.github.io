This work developed interpretable machine learning models to predict interstitial stability and formation energy in HCP metals. The study provides valuable insights into the role of alloying elements on non-metallic interstitials.

**Role**: First author

**Research Contributions**:
- Calculated 1,050 HCP structures with non-metallic interstitials under substitutional elements
- Developed interpretable formulas using SISSO (Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator)
- Applied SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for feature importance analysis
- Achieved accurate predictions of interstitial stability and energy with physically meaningful descriptors
- Provided design guidelines for HCP alloy development

**Status**: Accepted for publication
