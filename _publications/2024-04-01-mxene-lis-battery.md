## Abstract

Both the sluggish sulfur redox reaction (SRR) kinetics and lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttle effect limit the practical application of Li-S batteries. Designing heterostructure sulfur hosts has emerged as an effective way to address these two issues with one material. However, the principles of heterostructures reinforced Li-S batteries remain inadequately understood. Here, it is demonstrated for the first time that increasing the entropy of heterostructure can promote its sulfur redox reaction catalytic activity and alleviate the lithium polysulfide shuttling. By integrating MXene-based heterostructures with varying entropy levels, this study reveals that higher configurational entropy enhances the electrocatalytic activity toward sulfur species and strengthens the chemical binding with polysulfides, thereby improving both reaction kinetics and cycling stability in Li-S batteries.

This work utilized DFT calculations to investigate the energy and diffusion behavior of triple-interface MXene-based heterostructures. The entropy-driven design approach provides insights into developing efficient electrocatalysts for lithium-sulfur battery applications.
